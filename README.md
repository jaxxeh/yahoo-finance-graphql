- an example of a structured [apollo-server-express]()-based GraphQL API
- an example of providing GraphQL subscriptions over web sockets using [graphql-subscriptions]() and [subscriptions-transport-ws]()
- an example of using [Puppeteer]() to pilot headless browser automation in order to collect authentication data and circumvent access restrictions
